#Simple Can Collector Program

'''
    Decomposition:
    1. Load the list of cans collected. 
    2. Determine the number of functions.
    3. Calculate the total.
    4. Calculate the average.
    5. Calculate the total number of classrooms.
    6. Find the grade the collected the most cans.
    7. Print all calculations to the screen. 


    Main():
        houses the list of cans each grade collected
        Passes the cans list to the function Calculations
        Passes the cans list to the method Highest_Cans_Collected
        Prints the values returned from the Calculations function to the screen

    Calculations(cans):
        This function takes the cans list as a parameter to do calculations on. 
        The cans go through a for loop to find the total and the number of classrooms
        The average is calculated from the total and number of classrooms
        The total, average, and the number of classrooms are returned back to main()

    Highest_Cans_Collected(cans):
        This function accepts the cans list as a parameter
        There is a for loop that sorts through the list of cans and finds the highest number and saves the index of that number
        That index correlates to a grade
        the grade that collected the most cans is printed to the screen
